In many of these emerging applications of BFS, such as analyzing social networks, the input graphs are low-diameter and scale-free. We propose a hybrid approach that is advantageous for low-diameter graphs, which combines a conventional top-down algorithm along with a novel bottom-up algorithm. The bottom-up algorithm can dramatically reduce the number of edges examined, which in turn accelerates the search as a whole. On a multi-socket server, our hybrid approach demonstrates speedups of 3.3\&\#x2013;7.8 on a range of standard synthetic graphs and speedups of 2.4\&\#x2013;4.6 on graphs from real social networks when compared to a strong baseline. We also typically double the performance of prior leading shared memory (multicore and GPU) implementations.},

	abstract = {Graphs are powerful data representations favored in many computational domains. Modern GPUs have recently shown promising results in accelerating computationally challenging graph problems but their performance suffered heavily when the graph structure is highly irregular, as most real-world graphs tend to be. In this study, we first observe that the poor performance is caused by work imbalance and is an artifact of a discrepancy between the GPU programming model and the underlying GPU architecture.We then propose a novel virtual warp-centric programming method that exposes the traits of underlying GPU architectures to users. Our method significantly improves the performance of applications with heavily imbalanced workloads, and enables trade-offs between workload imbalance and ALU underutilization for fine-tuning the performance. Our evaluation reveals that our method exhibits up to 9x speedup over previous GPU algorithms and 12x over single thread CPU execution on irregular graphs. When properly configured, it also yields up to 30\% improvement over previous GPU algorithms on regular graphs. In addition to performance gains on graph algorithms, our programming method achieves 1.3x to 15.1x speedup on a set of GPU benchmark applications. Our study also confirms that the performance gap between GPUs and other multi-threaded CPU graph implementations is primarily due to the large difference in memory bandwidth.},

Practical-time implementations using high-end computers are reported but are accessible only to a few. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) of today have high computation power and low price. They have a restrictive programming model and are tricky to use. The G80 line of Nvidia GPUs can be treated as a SIMD processor array using the CUDA programming model. We present a few fundamental algorithms - including breadth first search, single source shortest path, and all-pairs shortest path - using CUDA on large graphs. We can compute the single source shortest path on a 10 million vertex graph in 1.5 seconds using the Nvidia 8800GTX GPU costing \$600. In some cases optimal sequential algorithm is not the fastest on the GPU architecture. GPUs have great potential as high-performance co-processors.},

OPTabstract     = {<p>We present novel algorithms for computing discrete Fourier transforms with
                high performance on GPUs. We present hierarchical, mixed radix FFT algorithms for
                both power-of-two and non-power-of-two sizes. Our hierarchical FFT algorithms
                efficiently exploit shared memory on GPUs using a Stockham formulation. We reduce
                the memory transpose overheads in hierarchical algorithms by combining the
                transposes into a block-based multi-FFT algorithm. For non-power-of-two sizes, we
                use a combination of mixed radix FFTs of small primes and Bluestein’s algorithm.
                We use modular arithmetic in Bluestein’s algorithm to improve the accuracy. We
                implemented our algorithms using the NVIDIA CUDA API and compared their
                performance with NVIDIA’s CUFFT library and an optimized CPU-implementation
                (Intel’s MKL) on a high-end quad-core CPU. On an NVIDIA GPU, we obtained
                performance of up to 300 GFlops, with typical performance improvements of 2–4x
                over CUFFT and 8–40x improvement over MKL for large sizes.</p>},
